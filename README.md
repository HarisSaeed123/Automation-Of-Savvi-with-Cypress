# savvi-
I have done the manual testing and automation testing of savvi by using cypress and verify the email by using mailosaur
I have used the split method of javascript to generate the random emails for used in sign up and sign in form
I have created the separate files for selectior and data and used them in the test files by import and export statement
I have applied the page object model pattern and create the different functions to handle the test cases.
